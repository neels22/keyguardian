- thinking of implementing search functionality for user secrets
- maybe can use pagination to show limited secrets in one page
- 

- need to create a form that accepts the secret and then a save button to save it to the database
- if its a website password ask for url 

- what if user stores bank secrets - might have fields more than username and password 
- user can be suggested to use secret nickname such as bank transaction password 
- 

- for simplicity maybe just create two fields username and secret field
